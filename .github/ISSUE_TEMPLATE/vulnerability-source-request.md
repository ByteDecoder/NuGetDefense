**Source**
A clear and concise description of what the source is (Database, Rest API, Vulnerability Feed)  and the way this source should be accessed.

**Why should this source be considered?**
Having NuGet Defense Check many sources would just slow down the build process unless there is an advantage to using a specific source over the others.

**Should this source be checked by default?**
Yes/No, Why?

**Would this be better in an independent package?**
If the source is not likely to appeal to a wider audience, would significantly increase build time, or would significantly increase the size of the package, it may be better in it's own package that could be installed independantly of NuGetDefense (ex NuGetDefense.SourceName).
